#Dassault-Rafale-M-flight-simulator
The research paper and project explores the implementation of an interactive flight simulation of the Dassault Rafale M using the Unity platform. The focus is on the technical aspects of flight modeling, the realism of visual effects and sounds, and the general implementation of functions of a combat aircraft's flight. Through the analysis of implemented elements, the paper provides insight into the complexity of creating flight simulations of military aircraft in a virtual environment. With an emphasis on the Unity tool, it investigates the challenges and solutions in integrating realistic flight characteristics into an interactive experience. Additionally, the paper highlights the need for further research in the field of flight simulations within game development frameworks.
